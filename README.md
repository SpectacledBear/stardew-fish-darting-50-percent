# Fish Darting at 50% Mod

This is a mod for Stardew Valley that replaces all fish data with fish that have their darting rate set to 50% of default. Otherwise the fish are identical to their defaults.

## Instructions

1. Install SMAPI
2. Install the Content Patcher mod
3. Copy the `[CP] 50% Fish Difficulty` directory in this repostory to your `Mods` folder in Stardew

## Reference

According to the [Modding:Fish data page](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Fish_data) on the Stardew Valley wiki, the syntax of the fish data is:

`<name>/<chance to dart>/darting randomness>/<min size>/<max size>/<min time max time>/<season>/<weather>/<locations>/<max depth>/<chance>/<depth multiplier>/<fishing level>/<first-catch tutorial eligible>`
